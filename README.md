# AquaTitan: The Micro-Plastic Collecting Autonomous Boat for UofT Praxis II üåäüåçü§ñ

Welcome to the AquaTitan project! This is an innovative project for the "Praxis II" course at the University of Toronto (UofT). Our mission is to develop an autonomous boat that can navigate the world's water bodies, efficiently collect micro-plastics from their surfaces, and autonomously dock for maintenance and disposal of collected waste.

## Overview

AquaTitan is a cutting-edge solution designed to tackle the growing problem of micro-plastic pollution in our oceans, lakes, and rivers. By utilizing a specialized net system for collecting micro-plastics and OpenCV-based computer vision techniques for autonomous docking, AquaTitan can efficiently clean various aquatic environments.

Our primary goal is to create a sustainable and efficient system that contributes to the global effort of reducing plastic pollution and preserving our ecosystems for future generations.

## Features

- Autonomous navigation through water bodies using GPS and inertial sensors.
- Surface micro-plastic collection using a specialized net system.
- Autonomous docking with ArUco marker detection through OpenCV-based computer vision algorithms.
- Dock-based automatic net-swapping system for efficient waste disposal.
- Environmentally-friendly design with solar panels for energy harvesting.
- Scalable and modular design to accommodate varying payload capacities.
